# CyberbullyingNeuralNetwork

## Project Description

This is my Computer Science Non-exam Assessment (NEA) project.

The goal of this project was to build a neural network that would predict the likelihood a piece of text is used for cyberbullying. 

The model is trained and hosted on an ASP .NET Core REST API, to be used in a simple frontend demo application.
